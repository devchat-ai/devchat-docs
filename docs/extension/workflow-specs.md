# Workflow Specifications

## Command

The command is a consolidated representation of an operation in a chat with an LLM.
Such an operation can either provide information to the chat or be triggered by the LLM to perform tasks beyond mere texting.
The unified command definition applies to LLM calls, scripts, and other user interfaces.
Consequently, users only need to define a command once in an easy-to-ready YAML file, enabling its use as LLM functions, script execution, and UI integration.
