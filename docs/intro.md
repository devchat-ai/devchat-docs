# Introduction

DevChat is an open-source platform that empowers developers to leverage AI for code generation and documentation.

## Rationale

While there are many AI coding tools available, we created DevChat based on our practical insights gained from generating tens of thousands of lines of code. If you agree with our perspectives outlined below, DevChat should be a perfect choice for you.

- **The bottleneck in harnessing AI's capabilities lies in how to embed the right context in a prompt**. This isn't merely about the token limit of an AI model's input. Even with an infinite number of tokens, existing AI models would struggle to yield satisfactory results without a proper separation of concerns.
- **The value of prompt "engineering" is often overstated**. While a well-crafted prompt template is helpful, it doesn't justify spending days or weeks of study. Instead, dedicate an hour or two to create a few effective templates and share them with your team.
- The art of writing prompts is a skill honed through practice. It's not about templates or engineering, but about **refining individual prompts for specific tasks on a case-by-case basis**.
- **Use AI only when it truly adds value**. Our misconception about AI's capabilities in reality is even a greater issue than hallucination of LLMs. What we need is a tool that boosts productivity, not merely an experiment.
